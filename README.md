# Toast Client for Forge

## READ ME
Toast client for forge is no longer being maintained the main reason being that toast client started as a fabric mod and a backport just wasn't realistic so we will only be maintaining the latest version. If you wish contribute still go for it, just fork and create a pull request. If you have any other questions please ask in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/gxyWEdG)
